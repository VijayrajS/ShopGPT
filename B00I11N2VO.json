Impressive -- it shows that they intend for their products to be used.\n\nRoom for improvement?  Only this, in my opinion:  The Velcro isn't strong enough to hold such a heavy unit reliably -- can you also provide a 3M Dual Lock template (or something similarly strong) for the bottom of the unit ?\n\nThey've jam-packed the unit with reverb features.  All sound good-to-great.\n\nIf you're on a budget, I don't think you can do better than this unit.  It's solidly made, covers just about anything you'd want a reverb to do, and the algorithms they use are excellent.",

The only thing that kills this reverb pedal is a strymon big sky or blue sky...at the 350$ and 500$. This is a mono or stereo output pedal. To truly appreciate appreciate this pedal you need to hear it in a stereo setup where it opens of from a one dimensional reverb to a environmental monster.

        "reviewText": "I chose this pedal after a thorough evaluation of many styles / brands / price ranges. The good news for reverb fans is that there are a great many very good choices at a wide price point. You can spend as little as $40 or well over $300. Youtube has demos on most of them so choosing is quite enjoyable and educational. The cheap ones are attractive from a price perspective but one must consider reliability along with functionality, versatility and sound. I wanted a reverb with several distinct voices and most certainly wanted one that provided the ability to create drones (in conjunction with my delay pedal), ambient swells AND had some of those awesome cool shimmer / halo / ghost / cavern voices - and there are many reverb units that do. I considered everything from a Dispatch Master to a Blue Sky to a Polaris to an Aftermath and many others. I am sure nearly all of them would have made me happy as all are great with their own personalities. Digitech's Supernatural has a good many demos which means a good many people enjoy it. I was impressed with everything I heard - from traditional spring, plate and hall to its dreamscape modes. I bought the S.A. and have not regretted it. Every mode can be set to be subtle and traditional (amp-like) and can be progressively ramped up to mind blowing extremes. It inspires you to create. It turns simple articulated chords into massive and beautiful colors. The volume swells you can create are a gift from outer space in rich tones and harmonics. It is an absolute blast. I haven't had it long enough to move it around extensively in my pedal chain so my experience to date is after distortion and modulation / before delay. At the current price point this cannot be beat - it competes easily with the Earthquaker line at 50-70% more $ and Strymon at nearly three times the cost. Some of the pedals may offer a few more features - and they better at the price - but this guy is well built, easy to use, is badass-cool looking and it sounds amazing to me in every mode. I seriously never knew reverb could be this much fun. Don't even think about not using a power supply.",

        "reviewText": "This pedal is exactly what I was looking for it has a bunch of different modes that all sound great and all the modes are actually really versatile thanks to the three primary controls\nThe mix nob controls the amount of reverb there is compared to your dry signal it goes from barely noticeable, subtle effects to 100% reverb. Most players will probably keep it at about 12 o'clock but if you turn it up really high its great for ambient, spacey, music.\nThe decay affects how long the reverb lasts. It goes from what's probably more sustain than you really need to really short punch sustain.\nThe liveliness control affects the amount of treble the effect processes. This makes your sound, as the name suggests, livelier. This makes the affect fuller, and more obvious, it also tends to increase sustain, so the way you set liveliness affects the other two controls. This gives the controls more diversity than it initially appears to because all the controls more or less work together so one change affects several attributes. This is really nice for fine tuning your sound.\nThe different modes all have really nice sounds as well, not only are there the ambient modes but plate and spring modes that aren't ambient, this gives the pedal the versatility to be used in almost any kind of music\nthe plate mode is the classic sounding reverb you probably hear in most music, you can use this setting in almost any kind of music, I use it a lot for rock and metal.\nThe plate mod mode is basically the same as the plate mode with a little chorus added to the affect. I don't really use it that much because I use my own chorus sound but it's still a really good usable effect.\nThe spring mode is also the classic spring reverb effect we all know and love. I tend to use it a bit more than the plate mode but they are both great, studio quality, reverbs.\nThe ambient settings are stunning\nEspecially shine. It has a cascading pitch shift added to the effect that makes a really creepy, haunting, sound. I love this effect honestly if this was the only setting the pedal would still be worth it. If you turn the mix down it adds a really eerie sound to your guitar that isn't to over the top. And with the liveliness turned way up it makes some hauntingly beautiful sounds.\nSupernova conjures up a spacey, strangely isolating, sound that unearthly beauty much like shine turning the mix down adds a really alien sound to your guitar that isn't to over the top. And with the liveliness turned way up it makes some crazy sounds.\nThe shimmer setting is basically the shine setting with chorus added, honestly I think this kind of ruins the effect so I don't use it much, but its still a quality effect.\nPherb is a hall reverb effect with heavy phasing added to it. I actually really like this sound. It's some what in between the \"standard' reverbs on the device and the ambient settings. It has a really unique sound that can be used for both ambient stuff and normal music\n\nAll and and all you can make some fantastic, and diverse, sounds with this pedal. I would recommend it for any style of music and it's the only reverb I'll use for the foreseeable future.",

I got it for the shimmer, plate, and plate mod settings, though, and in those areas it hasn't really disappointed (although the shimmer gets really eerie when it's played with bass notes).  However, I've since stopped using it and it has been put on our electric guitarist's board, and she's found it perfectly usable, especially on the spring setting (I didn't mention the spring before because I just avoid spring usually--personal preference).  Would I get it again?  Mmm...Probably not, not because it sounds bad, but because it just didn't jive with me.",
